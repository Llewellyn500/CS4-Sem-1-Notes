## Key Points
- 

## Detailed Notes
- A basic component must interact among themselves 
- the relationship among the components is known as the **structure** of the system
#### Goal 
**Central Objective**: the common goal
**Integration**: combined work of all the components to achieve the goal of the system.
**Synergistic effect**: 
#### Behaviour
- The way the system interacts with its environment.
- It's determined by procedures.

A system is an integrated collection of components which satisfy functions.
#### Elements of the system 
- **Input** -> It's the energising or the startup component on which the system operates
- **Processor** -> It's the activity that makes possible the transformation of the input to output.
- **Output** -> It's the end result of the operation.
#### Subsystem
- Smaller functional units which are of manageable sizes of complex systems.
- Module: A collection of functions or data.
- **Granularity** -> the level of detail with which you study a given system.
- **Interface** -> the interconnections & interactions among the subsystems.
- continuous system -> inputs can be varied by extremely small amounts or quantities

The entire set of relationships is referred to as the structure of the system
The nesting of systems within systems is referred to as a system hierarchy.

**Holism** -> the perspective 2hich claims that many aspects of a system can be understood only in terms of its entirety and not necessarily be reduced to the characteristics of its components.

**Entropy** -> the measure for disorder or energy degradation.

Major classes of performance measurement 
- **Effectiveness** -> measure of actual output against desired output (reason system exists)
- **Efficiency** ->  measure of relative cost of producing output.
