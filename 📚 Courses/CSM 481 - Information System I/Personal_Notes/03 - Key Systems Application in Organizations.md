## **Overview**

### Classification of Information Systems

**Vertical (Hierarchical) Approach:**
- **Concept:** Information systems (IS) are categorized based on the roles they play within the organizational hierarchy.
- **Management Pyramid:** According to the Laudon & Laudon framework, organizations are divided into four levels:
    - **Operational Level:** Day-to-day transactions and activities.
    - **Knowledge Level:** Supports employees who create and manage information.
    - **Management Level:** Provides support for planning, monitoring, and control.
    - **Strategic Level:** Helps senior managers with long-term planning and strategy formulation.

**Functional Specialties:**
- Each organizational function (e.g., sales, manufacturing, finance, HR) has its own dedicated systems that may further specialize into sub-functions (like inventory management or process control within manufacturing).
	- Sales and Marketing
	- Manufacturing
	- Finance
	- Accounting
	- Human Resources

### Four Main Types of Systems by Organizational Level

#### a. Operational-Level Systems

- **Purpose:**
    - Support daily, routine activities and transactions.
    - Answer simple questions such as “How many parts are in inventory?” or “What happened to a specific payment?”
- **Characteristics:**
    - Must deliver easily accessible, current, and accurate information.
    - Examples include systems for bank deposits, payroll, order entry, or tracking factory work.
- **Significance:**
    - These systems are central; any failure can have immediate, cascading effects on the business (e.g., airline reservation systems).

#### b. Knowledge-Level Systems

- **Purpose:**
    - Aid knowledge and data workers in creating and integrating new information.
    - Help manage the flow of paperwork and support innovation.
- **Types of Users:**
    - **Knowledge Workers:** Professionals (engineers, doctors, scientists) who create new information.
    - **Data Workers:** Staff (secretaries, clerks) who process and manage information.
- **Tools Involved:**
    - Workstations and office automation tools.
    - Examples include word processing, desktop publishing, document imaging, and electronic calendars.

#### c. Management-Level Systems

- **Purpose:**
    - Assist middle managers with monitoring, controlling, and decision-making.
    - Provide periodic reports to evaluate organizational performance.
- **Key Systems:**
    - **Management Information Systems (MIS):**
        - Summarize and report on internal operations.
        - Focus on planning and control by compressing detailed data into manageable reports.
    - **Decision Support Systems (DSS):**
        - Allow managers to generate customized reports.
        - Support semi-structured decisions and “what if” scenarios by integrating both internal data and external information.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Often not real-time; they provide periodic summaries (weekly, monthly, etc.).
    - Focus on structured questions with known data requirements.

#### d. Strategic-Level Systems

- **Purpose:**
    - Help senior executives address long-term issues and trends.
    - Support strategic decision-making by matching external changes with organizational capabilities.
- **Key System:**
    - **Executive Support Systems (ESS)/Executive Information Systems (EIS):**
        - Provide a broad view by filtering and compressing data from various sources.
        - Emphasize ease-of-use (often through graphical interfaces) for managers who may not be IT experts.
- **Example Questions ESS May Answer:**
    - “What business should we be in?”
    - “What are our competitors doing?”
    - “Which acquisitions might protect us against economic swings?”

### Six Major Types of Information Systems

Each of these types corresponds to one or more of the organizational levels described above:

1. **Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)**
    - **Level:** Operational.
    - **Role:**
        - Perform and record daily transactions.
        - Update corporate databases (e.g., sales orders, payroll, reservations).
    - **Importance:**
        - Critical for smooth operations; a failure can disrupt the entire business.
    
2. **Knowledge Work Systems (KWS)**
    - **Level:** Knowledge.
    - **Role:**
        - Aid professionals in creating new knowledge.
        - Support tasks that require creativity and specialized technical skills.
    
3. **Office Automation Systems (OAS)**
    - **Level:** Knowledge.
    - **Role:**
        - Enhance productivity of office workers.
        - Manage documents, scheduling, and communication (e.g., email, videoconferencing).
    
4. **Management Information Systems (MIS)**
    - **Level:** Management.
    - **Role:**
        - Provide summary reports from TPS data.
        - Help managers plan, control, and make routine decisions.
    
5. **Decision Support Systems (DSS)**
    - **Level:** Management.
    - **Role:**
        - Support semi-structured and unique decision-making scenarios.
        - Incorporate analytical models and external data to simulate “what if” scenarios.
    
6. **Executive Support Systems (ESS)**
    - **Level:** Strategic.
    - **Role:**
        - Provide senior executives with an integrated, high-level view of organizational data.
        - Use graphic interfaces and allow quick access to trends, exceptions, and external information.

## Integration of Systems

- **Interconnection:**
    - Systems at different levels are not isolated. For example, data from TPS feeds into MIS, DSS, and ESS.
- **Balancing Integration and Cost:**
    - While integration enhances information flow, it comes at a cost in terms of time and money.
    - Organizations must balance the benefits of integration against the challenges of large-scale, complex system linkage.
- **No One-Size-Fits-All:**
    - The ideal level of integration or centralization varies by organization and its specific needs.
