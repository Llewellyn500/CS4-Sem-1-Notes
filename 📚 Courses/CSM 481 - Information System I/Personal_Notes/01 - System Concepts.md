## **Overview**

### Introduction

- Information system is a special type of system
- system theory (or concept) provides a useful framework for describing and understanding many organizational phenomena including features of information systems and how they may be analyzed and designed.

#### What is system?

- Greek word "==systema==", meaning "==the organized relationship among the functioning units==".
- A system is an organized assembly of components with special relationships between the components

#### Characteristics of System

- Basic components - identifiable and moving parts of the system.
- Interaction and structure
- Goal
- Behavior - the way the system reacts to its environment
- Life Cycle

#### Elements of the system

- Input
- Processor
- Output


Model represents a system with its elements which keeps the system in equilibrium.

#### **Additional Concepts**

- **Boundary & Environment** – Defines system limits and interactions with external elements.
- **Subsystem** – Smaller functional units that form part of a larger system (e.g., sales, marketing in a business system).
- **Interface** – Communication paths between subsystems.
- **Feedback Control** – Adjustments based on output analysis to optimize system performance.
- **Black Box** – A subsystem where **inputs and outputs are known, but the internal process is unclear**.


#### **Types of Systems**

1. **Conceptual & Physical Systems**
    - **Conceptual (abstract)**: Based on ideas (e.g., Economic Theory).
    - **Physical**: Operational, tangible systems (e.g., Management Information System).
    
2. **Closed & Open Systems**
    - **Closed**: Self-contained, no interaction with the environment (e.g., a sealed chemical reaction).
    - **Open**: Exchanges materials, information, and energy with the environment (e.g., business organizations).
    
3. **Deterministic & Probabilistic Systems**
    - **Deterministic**: Predictable operations (e.g., a computer system).
    - **Probabilistic**: Outcomes are uncertain with a degree of error (e.g., weather forecasting).
    
4. **Natural & Artificial Systems**
    - **Natural**: Exist in nature (e.g., Solar system).
    - **Artificial**: Man-made (e.g., Computers, Airplanes).
    
5. **Integrated Systems** – Combination of related subsystems (e.g., Airline Reservation System).
    
6. **Dynamic & Static Systems**
    - **Dynamic**: Has ongoing processes and activities.
    - **Static**: No activity.
    
7. **Continuous & Discrete Systems**
    - **Continuous**: Inputs/outputs vary smoothly.
    - **Discrete**: Inputs/outputs have distinct, separate values.

#### **Systems View and Thinking**

- Adopting a **systemic perspective** helps understand **interrelationships** among system components.
- A **technical-only approach** often fails to consider the broader system interactions.
- The systems view involves adopting the reference framework and the terminology of systems theory, trying to apply various analogies with other systems and checking which of the systems laws and theories hold for the system of interest.

##### **Key Concepts**

- **Structure and Hierarchy** – Systems exist in **nested layers** (e.g., a business has departments, which have teams, etc.).
- **Holism and Emergent Properties** – The system as a whole is **greater than the sum of its parts**.
- **Entropy** – Over time, systems become disordered unless energy is introduced. (The measure for disorder or energy degradation)

#### **Organizational Efficiency and Effectiveness**

They are the 2 major classes of performance measurement:
- **Effectiveness** – Measures actual output vs. desired output.
- **Efficiency** – Measures resource utilization to produce output.
- Organizations often prioritize **efficiency over effectiveness**, which may lead to optimized processes but suboptimal results.

#### **Organizations as Systems**

- A business is an **organizational system** that transforms inputs (resources) into outputs (goods/services).
- **Information Systems**:
    - Have **interrelated components** (people, hardware, software, networks).
    - Work towards a **common goal** using input-processing-output.
    - Utilize **feedback and control** mechanisms (error messages, user access control).
    - Many **adapt to their environments** (e.g., AI-driven decision support systems).

- A system does not exist in a vacuum; rather it exists and functions in an environment containing other systems.









## **Key Concepts**

- **Structure of the system** - The relationship among the components which define the boundary between the system and environment 
- **Central Objective:** means common goal, because without a common goal, a system will start moving in all directions
- **Integration:** This is combined work of all the components in order to achieve the goal of the system
- **Synergistic effect:** From the integration concept it is clear that the system has to be viewed as "whole" rather than just as sum of its parts, the integrating effect is called this.
- Module - A collection of function or data.
- Functional cohesion - The general principle in decomposition which assumes that system objectives dictate the process.
- Granularity - The level of detail with which you study a given system.
- Control - Its the mechanism whereby the system is able to modify the processes and activities (behavior)
- Feedback loop - The 'round trip' of using output signals and using them to modify input signals.
- Lag - A slight delay before the output can be interpreted.
- Reductionism - opposite of holism
- Emergent properties - Certain properties, qualities or attributes which cannot be reduced to or understood from its components alone
