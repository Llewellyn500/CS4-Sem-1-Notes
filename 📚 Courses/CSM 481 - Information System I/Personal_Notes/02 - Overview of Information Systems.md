## **Overview**

#### **The Growing Importance of Information Systems**

- **Evolving Role of Information:**  
    Historically, information wasn’t seen as a critical asset. Today, effective handling of information is essential for organizational success.
- **Technological Advances:**  
    Rapid improvements in computer technology—with more powerful, user-friendly, and affordable systems—have transformed how organizations operate.

#### **Driving Forces Behind Information Systems**

- **Globalization:**
    - Companies must operate on a global scale, requiring 24-hour communication and coordination with international partners, distributors, and suppliers.
    - Global competition forces firms to adopt robust information systems to manage trade and business activities.
    
- **Knowledge-and-Information-Based Economy:**
    - Industrial powers are transitioning to economies driven by knowledge and information.
    - Quality information systems are vital for enhancing productivity, supporting innovative services (like credit/ATM systems), and sustaining competitive advantage.
    
- **Transformation of Business Enterprises:**
    - Traditional hierarchical and centralized organizations are evolving into flatter, decentralized, and flexible structures.
    - Modern businesses rely on instantaneous information to deliver mass-customized products and services.

#### **Defining Information Systems (IS)**

- **Core Definition:**  
    An Information System is an organized combination of:
    - **People:** End users and IS specialists.
    - **Hardware:** Computers and related devices.
    - **Software:** Programs and procedures.
    - **Communication Networks:** Media that support data exchange.
    - **Data Resources:** Raw data transformed into meaningful information.
- ==An Information System is any organized combination of people, hardware, software, communication networks, and data resources that collect, transform, and disseminates information to support decision-making and control in an organization.==
- **Primary Functions:**
    - **Input, Processing, and Output:** Transforming data into useful information.
    - **Feedback:** Returning output to refine and control processes.

#### **Components and Models of Information Systems**

- **Resource Dependencies:**  
    Information systems depend on human resources, hardware, software, data, and networks to perform activities such as input, processing, output, storage, and control.
- **Formal & Informal Systems:**
    - **Formal Systems (Computer-Based Information Systems[CBIS]):** Rely on clearly defined data and fixed procedures.
    - **Informal Systems (Office gossips networks YESE-YESE):** Operate on implicit agreements and unstated behavioral rules.
- **Distinctions:**  
    It is important to differentiate between a computer, a computer program, and a complete information system.

The components of a CBIS are the hardware, software, databases, telecommunications, people, and procedures that are configured to collect, manipulate, store, and process data into information.

- To understand Information Systems, one must understand
	- the problems they are designed to solve,
	- their architectural and design elements, and
	- the organizational process that lead to these solutions

#### **A Business Perspective on Information Systems**

- **Organizational Dimension:**
    - IS are embedded in organizational structures, culture, and standard operating procedures (SOP).
    - They help manage diverse roles—from knowledge workers to production staff—and navigate organizational politics.
    
- Organizations require many different kinds of skills and people.
	- **Knowledge workers** (such as engineers, architects, or scientists) design products or services and create new knowledge
	- **Data Workers** (such as secretaries, bookkeepers, or clerks) process the organization's paperwork.
	- **Production or service workers** (such as machinist, assemblers, or packers) actually produce the products or services of the organization.

- **Management Perspective:**
    - Managers use IS for strategic decision-making, resource allocation, and even re-designing organizational structures.
    - Each management level has distinct IS requirements, emphasizing the need for both IT literacy and an understanding of business processes.
    
- **Technological Dimension:**
    - Information system technology (e.g., computer-based information systems or CBIS) integrates hardware, software, databases, and telecommunications to solve business challenges.
    
- **Types of Information Systems:**
    - Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)
    - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
    - Knowledge Management Systems (KMS)
    - Management Information Systems (MIS)
    - Decision Support Systems (DSS)
    - Executive Support Systems (ESS)
    - Specialized Business Information Systems (e.g., AI, expert systems, virtual reality)

#### **New Options for Organizational Design**

- **Flatter Organizations:**
    - Reduced management layers empower lower-level employees with decision-making authority.
    - Global networks and modern IS broaden managerial control and coordination across geographies.
    
- **Separating Work from Location:**
    - Telecommunication technologies (email, internet, video conferencing) allow teams to collaborate regardless of physical location.
    - Organizations can operate globally while maintaining local operations.
    
- **Increasing Organizational Flexibility:**
    - Modern IS enable organizations to be agile, helping them quickly respond to market changes and capitalize on new opportunities.
    
- **Redefining Organizational Boundaries & Electronic Commerce:**
    - IS enable electronic transactions and data exchanges between companies, redefining traditional boundaries.
    - Interorganizational systems support seamless communication with customers, suppliers, and even competitors.
    
- **Reorganizing Workflows:**
    - Automation of work procedures reduces costs, increases efficiency, and improves service delivery (e.g., faster processing of insurance claims).





















## **Key Concepts**

- **Information** - Data that has been shaped into a form that is meaningful and useful to human beings.
- **Data** - streams of raw facts representing events occurring in orgs or physical environment before they have been organized into a firm that people can understand and use.
- **Standard Operating procedures (SOPs)** are formal rules for accomplishing tasks that have been developed over a long time
- **Inter-organizational systems** - Systems linking a company to its customers, distributors, or suppliers.
