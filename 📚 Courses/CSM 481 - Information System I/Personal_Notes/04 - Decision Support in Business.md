## **Overview**

### Introduction to Decision Support

- **Managerial Decision-Making Levels:**
    - **Strategic Management:**
        - Involves top executives and boards who set long‐term goals, strategies, and policies.
        - They monitor overall organizational performance in a changing environment.
    - **Tactical Management:**
        - Comprised of departmental heads and project teams that develop short- to medium-term plans, budgets, and schedules.
        - They allocate resources and monitor performance for their sub-units.
    - **Operational Management:**
        - Involves managers and team leaders focused on daily activities such as production schedules and task execution.
- **Key Insight:**
    - The type of information needed varies by decision-making level and the degree of structure in the decision situation.
    - Even in modern, flattened organizations, the classic managerial pyramid still applies.

## Information Requirements of Decision Makers

For decision support to be effective, information must have these characteristics:

- **Accurate:** Free from errors.
- **Complete:** Inclusive of all necessary details.
- **Economical:** Provided at a reasonable cost.
- **Flexible:** Adaptable to different situations.
- **Relevant:** Pertinent to the decision at hand.
- **Simple:** Easy to understand and use.
- **Reliable:** Consistently dependable.
- **Timely:** Available when needed.
- **Verifiable:** Confirmable by other data sources.
- **Accessible:** Easily retrievable by authorized users.
- **Secure:** Protected against unauthorized access.

These characteristics ensure that decision makers have the right information at the right time.

## Trends in Decision Support Systems (DSS)

- **Evolution of Decision Support:**
    
    - From the early days of Management Information Systems (MIS) and early DSS to today's integrated and user-driven systems.
- **Technological Advances:**
    
    - Rapid improvements in PC hardware/software, client/server networks, and the rise of corporate intranets/extranets have expanded decision support to lower management levels and individual teams.
- **Business Intelligence (BI) Tools:**
    
    - BI applications (e.g., DSS, data mining, OLAP) are now used not only internally but also by external stakeholders like suppliers and customers for enhanced decision making.

## Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and Data Mining

### Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)

- **Purpose:**
    - Enables managers and analysts to interactively examine large volumes of data from multiple perspectives in real time.
- **Key Operations:**
    - **Consolidation:**
        - Aggregates data (e.g., rolling up sales figures from local offices to regional totals).
    - **Drill-down:**
        - Allows users to view detailed data behind summary figures (e.g., individual sales figures contributing to regional totals).
    - **Slicing and Dicing:**
        - Offers multiple viewpoints by filtering data across different dimensions (e.g., sales by channel or product type).

### Data Mining

- **Purpose:**
    
    - Uncovers hidden patterns, trends, and correlations in large historical data sets.
- **Applications:**
    
    - Identifying profitable customer segments.
    - Reducing redundant costs.
    - Discovering unprofitable products or services.
    - Enhancing direct mail or e-mail campaigns.
- **Outcome:**
    
    - Supports knowledge discovery and provides actionable insights for business performance improvements.

## Decision Support Systems (DSS): Overview and Components

### Purpose and Philosophy of DSS

- **Objective:**
    - To help decision makers analyze large blocks of data using sophisticated models in a flexible, user-friendly way.
- **Focus:**
    - Supports semi-structured and unstructured decisions that do not have predefined algorithms.
- **Contrast with MIS:**
    - **MIS:** Often relies on structured, pre-designed information flows developed by professionals.
    - **DSS:** Emphasizes iterative, flexible, and interactive analysis, often directly involving end users.

### Components of a DSS

1. **Database Component:**
    - A repository of current and historical data drawn from various sources (e.g., production, sales).
    - Ensures data integrity and supports data extraction for analysis.
2. **Model Base:**
    - A collection of mathematical and analytical models (e.g., optimization, forecasting, sensitivity analysis).
    - Allows users to run “what-if” scenarios and analyze impacts of varying conditions.
3. **User Interface (DSS Software System):**
    - Provides a graphic, interactive, and easy-to-use interface.
    - Enables users to access data, run models, and generate customized reports.

### Example Use Cases

- **Financial Planning:**
    
    - Senior managers allocate funds and plan investments based on analysis provided by a financial DSS.
- **Operational Decisions:**
    
    - Middle managers may use the same system to monitor projects, track expenditures, and make resource allocation decisions.
- **Group Decision-Making:**
    
    - DSS can facilitate collective decision making by allowing multiple stakeholders to interact with data and models.

## Characteristics and Success Factors of DSS

### Characteristics of DSS

- **Support for Unstructured/Semi-Structured Problems:**
    - Designed to analyze problems that lack clear-cut solutions.
- **Iterative Development:**
    - DSS systems are continuously refined based on user feedback rather than “frozen” after initial development.
- **Group Support:**
    - Facilitate decision-making across groups or departments since many decisions in large organizations are collective.

### Factors Influencing DSS Success

- **User Training, Involvement, and Experience:**
    
    - Effective training and active involvement of users are critical.
- **Top Management Support:**
    
    - Endorsement and support from senior management help secure necessary resources and commitment.
- **Duration and Novelty:**
    
    - Long-term use and innovative application can significantly affect the perceived improvements in decision making.
- **Ease of Use and Flexibility:**
    
    - The interface and the system’s adaptability to changing conditions are vital for success.

## Enhancing Management Decision-Making with DSS

- **Philosophy:**
    - Provide tools for in-depth analysis rather than just delivering data.
- **Interconnection with Other Systems:**
    - DSS can either be tightly integrated with existing TPS, KWS, and MIS or operate as stand-alone systems developed by specific business units.
- **Flexibility in Application:**
    - Designed to be used at multiple levels within an organization—from senior management to individual project teams.
