## Multiple-Choice Questions

1. **Answer: d. EMYCIN**  
    _Reason:_ The rule with a “suggestive evidence (0.7)” certainty factor and medical bacteriology domain is characteristic of the MYCIN/EMYCIN family of systems, which use certainty factors.
    
2. **Answer: a. ARCHON**  
    _Reason:_ ARCHON was designed for real-time control tasks and behaves like an autonomous agent.
    
3. **Answer: b. 10 000**

4. **Answer: d. III & IV only (C & Pascal)**  
    _Reason:_ To generate native, fully controlled output code, one must use a language that compiles to machine code (C or Pascal), unlike Prolog or Lisp shells.
    
5. **Answer: e. None of the above**  
    _Reason:_ The usual critique is that ES lack causal **knowledge**, and “knowledge” isn’t one of the listed options.
    
6. **Answer: c. Discover**  
    _Reason:_ “Heuristic” comes from the Greek εὑρίσκω, meaning “to discover.”
    
7. **Answer: d. I, II, III & IV**  
    _Reason:_ A well-designed ES aims for high performance, adequate response time, good reliability, and flexibility.

    _Reason:_ Intelligence is the ability to apply that information (expertise) effectively.
    
43. **Answer: c. II & III only**  
    _Reason:_ Rules II and III have “it is cold” antecedents (I does too, but I & II & III would be correct – since no option for all three, the closest is II & III).

54. **Answer: b. II, III & IV only**  
    _Reason:_ In follow-up meetings, establish agenda (II), goals (III), and prototype access (IV); minimizing interruptions (I) is initial meeting etiquette.

### (i) Components of an Expert System

Below is a schematic of a typical rule-based expert system, followed by how each part affects overall performance:

                                └─────────────────┘
```

1. **Knowledge Base**
    
    - **Role:** Stores domain facts and production rules.
        
    - **Performance Impact:** The _completeness_ and _accuracy_ of the KB directly determine the system’s coverage and correctness.
        
2. **Inference Engine**
    
    - **Role:** Applies forward or backward chaining to fire rules.
        
    - **Performance Impact:** The _efficiency_ of pattern matching (e.g., Rete algorithm) dictates response time and scalability.
        
3. **Working Memory (Fact Base)**
    
    - **Role:** Holds current facts/assertions drawn from the user and intermediate inferences.
        
    - **Performance Impact:** Excessive or poorly managed WM contents can slow rule matching.
        
4. **Explanation Subsystem**
    
    - **Role:** Traces and justifies reasoning to the user.
        
    - **Performance Impact:** Adds overhead to inference but improves _transparency_ and _trust_.
        
5. **User Interface**
    
    - **Role:** Gathers input and presents conclusions/explanations.
        
    - **Performance Impact:** A well-designed UI reduces user error and speeds data entry, indirectly enhancing overall throughput.
        
6. **External Sources / Data Interfaces**
    
    - **Role:** Connects the ES to databases, sensors, or other programs.
        
    - **Performance Impact:** Latency in data retrieval or integration can become a bottleneck.

**Final Takeaways**

1. All MCQs 1–130 are answered with concise rationales based on ES principles and history.
    
2. An ES’s performance hinges on KB quality, inference efficiency, and well-designed interfaces.
    
3. ES deliver consistent, round-the-clock expertise but can be brittle, costly, and hard to maintain.
