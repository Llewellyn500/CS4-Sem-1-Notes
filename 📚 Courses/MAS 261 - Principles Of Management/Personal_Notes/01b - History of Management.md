#### **Major Approaches to management**

![[Pasted image 20250221093632.png]]

#### **Early Management**

- Ancient Management - Egypt (pyramids) and China (Great Wall)
- **Adam Smith (In 1776)**
	- Published "The Wealth of Nations"
	- Argued the economic advantages that orgs and society would gain from the **Division of Labor**
- **Division of Labor (Job specialization)** - It's the breaking down jobs into narrow and repetitive tasks.
- **Industrial Revolution (Late 18th century)** - machine power was substituted for human power.

#### **Classical Approach**

- It's the first study of management
- It emphasizes rationality and making organizations and workers as efficient as possible.
- It has 2 major theories:
	- Scientific management
	- General administrative
- The 2 most important contributors to **scientific management**:
	- **Frederick W. Taylor** *(father of scientific management)*
	- Husband-wife team of **Frank** and **Lillian Gilbreth** *(Taylor's most prominent followers)*
- The 2 most important contributors to **general administrative**:
	- **Henri Fayol**
	- **Max Weber**

#### **Scientific Management**

- An approach that involves using the scientific method to find the "one best way" for a job to be done.

##### **Taylor's scientific management principles**

1. Develop a science for each element of an individual's work to replace the old rule of thumb method.
2. Scientifically select and then train, teach, and develop the worker.
3. Heartily cooperate with the workers to ensure that all work is done in accordance with the principles of the science that has been developed.
4. Divide work and responsibility almost equally between management and workers. Management does all work for which it is better suited than the workers.

#### Frank and Lillian Gilbreth

- They were psychologist who studied to eliminate inefficient hand-and-body motions
- They devised a classification scheme to label 17 basic hand motions (Search, grasp, hold) called **Therblig**.

#### **General Administrative Theory**

- An approach to management that focuses on describing what managers do and what constitutes good management practice.

##### Henri Fayol

- He described the practice of management as something distinct from accounting, finance, production, distribution, and other typical business functions.
- He developed 12 principles of management - fundamental rules of management that could be applied to all organizational situations and thought in schools

##### Fayol's 14 principles of management

1. **Division of work** - Specialization increases output by making employees more efficient
2. **Authority** - Managers must be able to gives orders and authority gives them this right.
3. **Discipline** - Employees must obey and respect the rules that govern the organization
4. **Unit of command** - Every employee should receive orders from only one superior.
5. **Unit of direction** - The organization should have a single plan of action to guide managers and workers
6. **Subordination of individual interests to the general interest** - The interest of any one employee or group of employees should not take precedence over the interests of the organization as a whole.
7. **Remuneration** - workers must be paid a fair wage for their services.
8. **Centralization** - This term refers to the degree to which subordinates are involved in decision making.
9. **Scalar chain** - The line of authority from top management to the lowest ranks is the scalar chain
10. **Order** - People and materials should be in the right place at the right time
11. **Equality** - Managers should be kind and fair to their subordinates
12. **Stability of tenure of personnel** - Management should provide orderly personnel planning and ensure that replacements are available to fill vacancies
13. **Initiative** - Employees allowed to originate and carry out plans will exert high levels of effort
14. **Esprit de corps** - Promoting team spirit will build harmony and unity within the organization.

##### Max Weber

- a German Sociologist
- in early 1900s he developed a theory of authority structure and relations based on an ideal type of organization he called **bureaucracy**.
- Bureaucracy is a form of organization characterized by division of labor, a clearly defined hierarchy, detailed rules and regulations, and impersonal relationships

#### **Behavioral Approach**

- Organizational behavior (OB) - the field of study that researches the actions(behavior) of people at work
- 4 people stand out as the early advocates of the OB approach:
	- Robert Owen
	- Hugo Munsterberg
	- Marry Parker Follett
	- Chester Barnard

#### **Hawthorne Studies**

- A series of studies during the 1920s and 1930s that provided new insights into individual and group behavior.
- It concluded that people's behavior and attitudes are closely related, that group factors significantly affect individual behavior, that group standards establish individual worker output, and that money is less a factor in determining output than group standards, group attitudes, and security.
- These led to a new emphasis on the human behavior factor in the management of organizations.

#### **The Quantitative Approach** (Management Science)

- Its the use of quantitative techniques to improve decision making.
- Developed from World War II military mathematical and statistical solutions.

#### **Total Quality Management (TQM)**

- A philosophy of management that is driven by continuous improvement and responsiveness to customer needs and expectations.

##### What is Quality Management?

1. **Intense focus on the customer** - The customer includes outsiders who buy the organization's products or services and internal customers who interact with and serve others in the organization.
2. **Concern for continual improvement** - Quality management is a commitment to never being satisfied. "Very good" is not good enough. Quality can always be improved
3. **Process focused** - Quality management focuses on work processes as the quality of goods and services is continually improved
4. **Improvement in the quality of everything the organization does** - This relates to the final product, how the organization handles deliveries, how rapidly it responds to complaints, how politely the phones are answered, and the like.
5. **Accurate measurement** - Quality management uses statistical techniques to measure every critical variable in the organizations operations. These are compared against standards to identify problems, trace them to their roots, and eliminate their causes.
6. **Empowerment of employees** - Quality management involves the people on the line in the improvement process. Teams are widely used in quality management programs as empowerment vehicles for finding and solving problems.

#### **Contemporary Approaches**

- **System** - A set of interrelated and interdependent parts arranged in a manner that produces a unified whole.
- **Closed system** - systems that are not influenced by and do not interact with their environment
- **Open system** - system that interact with their environment

#### **The Contingency Approach** (Situational approach)

- Organizations are different, face different situations (contingencies), and require different ways of managing.

#### **Popular Contingency Variables**

- **Organization Size** - As size increases, so do the problems of coordination. For instance the type of organization structure appropriate for an organization of 50,000 employees is likely to be inefficient for an organization of 50 employees.
- **Routineness of Task Technology** - To achieve its purpose, an organization uses technology. Routine technologies require organizational structures, leadership styles, and control systems that differ from those required by customized or non routine technologies
- **Environmental Uncertainty** - The degree of uncertainty caused by environmental changes influences the management process. What works best in a stable and predictable environment may be totally inappropriate in a rapidly changing and unpredictable environment.
- **Individual Differences** - Individuals differ in terms of their desire for growth, autonomy, tolerance of ambiguity, and expectations. These and other individual differences are particularly important when managers select motivation techniques, leadership style and job designs.

- **Classical Approaches:**
    
    - **Scientific Management:**
        - Pioneered by Frederick W. Taylor, it emphasizes finding “the one best way” to perform tasks.
